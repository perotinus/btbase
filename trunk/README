-btbase - library/utility for reading/writing BattleTag base stations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------
Intro
-------------
This library/utility allows users and programmers to read and write (or write
code that reads and writes) BattleTag bases.

There are a few major components:
-btbaseutil     - a command-line application to read and write BattleTag bases
-test           - a command-line application that tests interaction with the library
-btbaseutil_qt  - a GUI application to read/write BattleTag bases (most people will
                  want this)

--------------------------
Requirements/Installation
--------------------------
See the INSTALL file.

Information
-------------
BattleTag base stations are simply Mifare Ultralight cards.  This library and
utility are designed to facilitate writing to Mifare Ultralight (and Ultralight
C, which are compatible) cards, allowing the user to read and write BattleTag
bases.  Using this software, it is possible to make copies of the given
BattleTag bases, as well as making additional bases that will respond much like

So, there are potentially:
-16 medkit types
-16 ammo types
-16 base types (!!)

Of course, there could be more - this limit of 16 each is determined by the fact
that each of the ammo/medkit/base types have the same major number, and with the
major number fixed, there are only 16 possible combinations with minor numbers.

There are 256 possible major-minor combinations that the gun can recognize.
Ubisoft only provides 8 base types, leaving a lot of room for expansion.  

It is possible to write to the Ubisoft base stations.  Be careful, you can turn
your ammo base into a medkit if you're not careful!  This could be confusing
during gameplay, though perhaps this could be part of some sort of crazy,
confusing game.
